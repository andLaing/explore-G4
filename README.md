# TLDR

```shell
mkcd abracadabra/build
cmake ..
make -j8
./tests-trial --list-test-names-only | while read testname; do ./tests-trial $testname; done
./abracadabra
```

# Caveats

## Dependency management with Nix

The above instructions assume that you have the required dependencies installed
and configured.

This is done automatically when you `cd` into the project's directory, if you
have installed the Nix package manager and `direnv`.

## Clang developer tools

Clang developer tools should largely work out of the box in the Nix-provided
environment. Crucially, they require some knowledge about how the project is
combined. This information is provided in `compile_commands.json` which is
automatically generated by CMake (unless you override the setting of
`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`).

TODO: describe which tools are available, what they can do for you, and how to
use them.
