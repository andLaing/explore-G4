# TLDR

```shell
just     # (build, if necessary, and) run the tests
just run # (build, if necessary, and) run the default model in batch mode
just interact # (build ... and) load the default model in interactive mode
just interact nema7-model      # load nema7-model in interactive mode
just run nema7-model nema7-run # load nema7-model and run nema7-run in batch mode
just list-models  # list available first arguments for `just run/interact`
just list-runs    # list available second arguments for `just run`
just -l  # list all recipes

# Caveats

## Dependency management with Nix

The above instructions assume that you have the required dependencies installed
and configured.

This is done automatically when you `cd` into the project's directory, if you
have installed the Nix package manager and `direnv`.

## Clang developer tools

Clang developer tools should largely work out of the box in the Nix-provided
environment. Crucially, they require some knowledge about how the project is
combined. This information is provided in `compile_commands.json` which is
automatically generated by CMake (unless you override the setting of
`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`).

TODO: describe which tools are available, what they can do for you, and how to
use them.
